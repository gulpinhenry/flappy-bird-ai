## Description

A program that uses the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm to play Flappy Bird. NEAT is a generation-based method which imitates natural selection to evolve neural networks. The game design was implemented using pygame, and solely played by the computer. The user can change the population size in the config file to increase the rate of learning, but it is ultimately able to play Flappy Bird at an extremely proficient level.


## Prerequisites
